### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The labs dealt with React so I did feel as if the labs prepared me to deal with a majority of what the project requires. But, one subject I believe could've used more focus in the labs was the API calling; I felt as if I understood
most of what was being shown in the labs but once it came down to API handling, I had a hard time understanding how it all worked.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have taken more time to format my code and properly solve all the bugs that could show up. I would have added my own features outside of the expected stretch goals, such as a review component.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Almost everything was perfect except for one bug. I found in my code that if the load more button works as intended, the search feature does not work, and vice versa. This would not have happened if I took the time to organize my code, as per
  last question's answer.
